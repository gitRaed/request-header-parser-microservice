# [Request Header Parser Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/request-header-parser-microservice)

The original design of FreeCodeCamp was not changed, since the objective of these projects is to test my back-end skills.

This project has been saved on GitHub after finishing the project on replit.
